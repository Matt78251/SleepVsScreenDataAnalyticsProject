This project was to touch up on my data science and analytic skills using libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, statistics, and pandas.

For this project, I wanted to get a deeper understanding of the relationship between the amount of time people spend on their phone
and the amount of sleep people get per night. 

To do this, I made a survey to collect the number of hours people spent on their phone via their phone's screen time daily average and 
the number of hours of sleep people got per night. I also took gender into consideration where in which now I also intend to eventually 
rework the survey to add age data as well.

The final result displays a scatter plot where X is the Screen Time (in hours) and Y is the Sleep Time (in hours) with all of the participants
plots being displayed alongside a regression line. There is also some statistical data printed as well to better understand overall averages, 
the regression line, and covariance information.

Overall this was a fun project for me to work on and I do see how I can improve it in the future by collecting a bit more data through the survey.
